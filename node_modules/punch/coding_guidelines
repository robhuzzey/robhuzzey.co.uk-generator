Spacing
* Always run JSHint (with the .jshintrc provided in project's root) after making changes.
* { "key": value }
* if (cond) {

	} else {

	}
* funtion(params) {

	}
* function() { // single line }
* Use semicolons when ending statements.

* At the start of every function, define self with reference to this. (even, if you don't need it in the function. Having self defined will avoid someone unknowingly referencing this.)
* Always, return when calling the callback function.
* Use meaningful argument names for callbacks, don't name everything callback or cb.
	eg. file_stream.on("directory", function(entry, next) { });

* use camel case only for public properties. Use underscored names for private variables.
* Don't invoke callbacks inside try/catch blocks. That makes debugging the errors occur in callbacks a nightmare.

* Ways to handle callbacks

Releases:

* API will become stable at 1.0
* We use semantic versioning (no, release candidates)
